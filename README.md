# Restful_Task_API
Using knowledge of 'Restful Routing', created an application with endpoints (routing rules) which offer CRUD operations for 'tasks'. We are able to use this API for the following commands:

Retrieve all Tasks
Retrieve a Task by ID
Create a Task
Update a Task by ID
Delete a Task by ID
The tasks are responded in a json format. Consider the tasks being objects with the following properties:

_id: (string) (default id generated by mongoDB)
title: (string)
description: (string, default to empty string)
completed: (boolean, default to: false)
created_at: (date, default to current date)
updated_at: (date, default to current date)
